This is a project that I made on Program Consultores as a part of the Full Stack Developer training between the months of january and february of based on some client requirements. 
After the analysis and technical histories stage, we developed a Wizard-page to simulate the loading of traffic infraction reports with their report in PDF. 
To do that, I created a Database on SQL Server and developed the functionality on Visual Studio, using ASP .Net. 
The frontend was made by using HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, Jquery and Bootstrap.
The testing also was made.
